              <p class="text-block__desc mb-20">The founder and CEO of IBHL is the son of a Freedom Fighter. The journey began with Dr Prajendra Choudhary’s education and training at JJ Hospital where he laid the foundation for the first-class service. For example, we delivered a 99.9% success rate in Bacterial Meningitis (0% with meningococcal meningitis), a 100% successful outcome of pituitary tumor post-surgical management, and 100% survival of patients admitted with Pemphigus Vulgaris. During his graduation, post-graduation in Medicine, and sub-specialization in Neurology, he had a zero tolerance for sub-standard care. Subsequently, he went to the UK for higher studies and was fortunate to be educated and trained at premier institutes such as Guy’s Hospital, Great Ormond Street, and King’s College Hospital, London. He worked as a Consultant at Queen’s Medical Centre and later started his own company with a small team of highly committed personnel. Over the last two decades, he has studied various aspects of healthcare that gave him a unique perspective on healthcare services in the UK, USA, Australia, and New Zealand. He toured almost the entire Vidarbha and interacted with local villagers, patients, NGOs, Vrudhashrams, and doctors to understand the current healthcare service within our country.</p>
              <p class="text-block__desc mb-20">During his tour through Vidarbha, he observed that the patients have very little say in how the healthcare is delivered. IBHL believes in the well-known quote attributed to Mahatma Gandhiji. “A Customer is the most important visitor on our premises. He is not dependent on us; we are dependent on him. He is not an interruption of our work; he is the purpose of it. He is not an outsider to our business; he is a part of it. We are not doing him a favor by serving him; he is doing us a favor by allowing us to do so.” <a href="https://www.mkgandhi.org/faq/q7.php" target="_blank">(https://www.mkgandhi.org/faq/q7.php)</a> and also a Bombay Hospital motto <a href="https://www.regioner.dk/media/3957/slides-jette-bay.pdf" target="_blank">(https://www.regioner.dk/media/3957/slides-jette-bay.pdf)</a>. Let us not forget; because of them doctors, nurses, and paramedics exist!</p>

                <p class="blog-author__bio">We agree that healthcare is not a “business”. IBHL believes that the healthcare service should be an enterprise and an organization with social commitments to ensure that the ultimate benefits from its activities go to the patient. To achieve this, IBHL will establish strong corporate governance to demonstrate our work ethics and achievements.</p>

            <div class="text-block mb-50">
              <p class="text-block__desc mb-20">IBHL believes that without the active participation of the patients, we cannot truly become a patient-centric healthcare organization. We believe that they will guide us, educate us, and help us deliver the service that they want and the way they want. Hence, their participation is critical in our mission to deliver the best healthcare system that is suitable for them. This will be a most challenging mission because IBHL will need to balance between the business needs and the patient’s needs to sustain itself and be able to deliver what the patients need. It will be an arduous task, but we believe that with trust and joint efforts, we will live up to Modiji’s vision of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas.</p>
