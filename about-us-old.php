              <p class="text-block__desc mb-20">The founder and CEO of IBHL is the son of a Freedom Fighter. The journey began with Dr Prajendra Choudhary’s education and training at JJ Hospital where he laid the foundation for the first-class service. For example, we delivered a 99.9% success rate in Bacterial Meningitis (0% with meningococcal meningitis), a 100% successful outcome of pituitary tumor post-surgical management, and 100% survival of patients admitted with Pemphigus Vulgaris. During his graduation, post-graduation in Medicine, and sub-specialization in Neurology, he had a zero tolerance for sub-standard care. Subsequently, he went to the UK for higher studies and was fortunate to be educated and trained at premier institutes such as Guy’s Hospital, Great Ormond Street, and King’s College Hospital, London. He worked as a Consultant at Queen’s Medical Centre and later started his own company with a small team of highly committed personnel. Over the last two decades, he has studied various aspects of healthcare that gave him a unique perspective on healthcare services in the UK, USA, Australia, and New Zealand. He toured almost the entire Vidarbha and interacted with local villagers, patients, NGOs, Vrudhashrams, and doctors to understand the current healthcare service within our country.</p>
              <p class="text-block__desc mb-20">During his tour through Vidarbha, he observed that the patients have very little say in how the healthcare is delivered. IBHL believes in the well-known quote attributed to Mahatma Gandhiji. “A Customer is the most important visitor on our premises. He is not dependent on us; we are dependent on him. He is not an interruption of our work; he is the purpose of it. He is not an outsider to our business; he is a part of it. We are not doing him a favor by serving him; he is doing us a favor by allowing us to do so.” <a href="https://www.mkgandhi.org/faq/q7.php" target="_blank">(https://www.mkgandhi.org/faq/q7.php)</a> and also a Bombay Hospital motto <a href="https://www.regioner.dk/media/3957/slides-jette-bay.pdf" target="_blank">(https://www.regioner.dk/media/3957/slides-jette-bay.pdf)</a>. Let us not forget; because of them doctors, nurses, and paramedics exist!</p>

                <p class="blog-author__bio">We agree that healthcare is not a “business”. IBHL believes that the healthcare 
service should be an enterprise and an organization with social commitments to 
ensure that the ultimate benefits from its activities go to the patient. To achieve this, 
IBHL will establish strong corporate governance to demonstrate our work ethics and 
achievements.</p>

                    <p>One of the strong pillars of our service will be the patient forum. 
                        This will allow us to learn from the patients about their expectations and adapt to their needs. We will listen to their complaints, address them, learn from them, and modify our practices to ensure that the same error does not recur. We will also listen to their complaints, but we will not get carried away. We believe that there are opportunities to learn from within the lines of those complaints. We want EVERY PATIENT to receive the most ideal healthcare possible within the limits of financial restraints.</p>

                    <p>IBHL will develop a work ethos that will help to build an environment of trust so that clinical excellence will flourish. IBHL believes that if we empower people working for us, they will transfer the benefits to the patients. We believe that collectively we can make a difference in the patient experience during their journey through the complex maze of the healthcare system. IBHL will have a strong governance structure to ensure that the best practices are adopted and sustained.</p>
                    <p>We want to work in partnership with others. On our own, we cannot make an impact on the healthcare system. If we want to achieve the best healthcare system, we need to work in partnership with others who will share our vision. When our Prime Minister said “Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas”, Modiji envisioned cumulative growth in development and progress. We share his vision and align ourselves with his goal to ensure that EVERYONE WORKING with us will grow and progress. So, please let us work together.</p>

                    <p>Most of the patients are living in villages and semi-urban cities BUT many of the cutting-edge medical facilities are within the major cities. This makes it difficult for patients to access the best healthcare facilities. Sometimes the right expert is not available even within the same city where the patient resides. 2nd 
                    Doctor’s Opinion (2ndro) platform will enable us to reach EVERYWHERE within our country.</p>

              <p class="text-block__desc mb-20">IBHL believes that without the active participation of the patients, we cannot truly become a patient-centric healthcare organization. We believe that they will guide us, educate us, and help us deliver the service that they want and the way they want. Hence, their participation is critical in our mission to deliver the best healthcare system that is suitable for them. This will be a most challenging mission because IBHL will need to balance between the business needs and the patient’s needs to sustain itself and be able to deliver what the patients need. It will be an arduous task, but we believe that with trust and joint efforts, we will live up to Bharat vision of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas.</p>
              <p class="text-block__desc mb-20">IBHL is very much aware of the existing organizations with similar visions and goals and who are actively working within the healthcare and other industries. We will learn from them and imbibe their principles so that we do not rediscover the circle. Hence, we welcome such organizations to please guide us in our venture.</p>
              <p class="text-block__desc mb-20">IBHL is very much aware that the doctors and others working within the organization will have their own experiences. They will have their innovative ideas that would help IBHL improvise its services.</p>
              <p class="text-block__desc mb-20">The CEO has been actively working with various social care workers in Vidarbha District to understand the current state of healthcare. He was crucial in laying the foundation for developing a healthcare in a village. He is actively involved in educating rural people on various health issues, sponsored sports facilities, funded books, and clean water for the rural schools. Soon he realized that funding for such activities from one's earnings is not sustainable. Hence, he decided to start a healthcare service in India and use a significant proportion of the income for social work.</p>
